# NHL-Positivity-Index

Inspired by Shannon Skanes' "Panic Index" series, we developed the NHL Positivity Index to quantitatively evaluate NHL fanbase sentiment using AI. Employing natural language processing and sentiment analysis, we analyze discussions and media commentary, primarily from Reddit, to gauge the mood and tone of fanbases over time.

Model Used: UAlbertaUAIS/Chelberta from HuggingFace Models

## code

- `calc_positivity_score.py`: Calculates positivity scores for teams based on a dataset of the submissions.
- `chart_dashboard.py`: generates a visual dashboard using matplotlib to display these rankings, team logos, and positivity scores in a table format, complete with custom styling and additional informational text. The dashboard is displayed and saved as a PDF file
- `comment_preprocessing.py`: Using regular expressions to take out unwanted characters from all of the reddit comments from a specific time period.
- `constants.py`: All of the variables used between all of the different python files.
- `label_data.py`: The model labelling all of the data from the json file of comments within a specific time period with positive, negative, neutral ratings.
- `main.py`:
- `reddit_login.py`: Logging into the Reddit API to extract data.
- `reddit.py`: Extracting all of the Comments from Reddit under users u/HockeyMod, from Specific users posting Game Threads, and From Flaired Posts
- `utils.py`: Searches for and collect subreddit submissions based on post flairs.
