Yes, Hynes' hockey was really boring, defense first hockey. But the Preds roster has been pretty thin for a long time. \n\nThere's a few reasons: \n\n1) We haven't really been buyers for the past 4 seasons. Poile did a really good job of not continuing to chase the cup and hoarding assets as much as possible, even though he wasn't tanking. I think this off season was the most aggressive we've been in a while. We had picked up a few rentals here and there on short term deals but nothing impactful. We've made a few trades: a second for Lauzon and a bag of pucks for McDonagh but they aren't exactly \"let's win game\" moves. I'm pretty sure McD was cover for Ekholm, who Poile had anticipated trading. \n\n2) There's a hole in our prospect graduation from the heavy spending years of our Cup chase that we're finally feeling. As Trotz said, \"it takes six years for a lot of draft prospects to make an impact.\"  Well remember our cup run and President's trophy? How many years ago was that again...\n\nWe didn't have a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd round draft pick in 2018 and sold off some prospects (Girard, Jones) in our \"win now\" mode. If you look at the guys who developed in 2015: Novak, 2017: Tolvanen, 2019: Tomasino, Afansyev - what we're missing is the 2-3 guys (plus Tolvanen) who would potentially be hitting the same development level as Tolvanen and Tomasino now - aka graduating into a full time, impactful role.  \n\n\n3) Beating a dead horse here but we are drafting way to low. All drafts are a gamble - we're picking 18 year olds and hoping they pan out at 22-24. The higher you get, the easier the bet is. And the quicker the development curve is. Bedard and others picked in the top of the draft are already in the NHL, meanwhile Matthew Wood is still hoping to transition from winger to center at UConn. No pick is a sure thing and there's always going to be busts.
