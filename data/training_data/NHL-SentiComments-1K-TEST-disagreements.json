    {
        "comment": "This is a lot if anyone cares to read. But my observations are:\\- Too many odd-man rushes going the other way. This usually happens because of our forwards forechecking too deep and getting caught out with 3 men deep. With slower/worse teams, we don't get burnt as bad and it can work in our favour as we can capitalize on mistakes. But against good teams an unsuccessful forecheck is extremely noticeable, often leading to 3 on 2's. To compensate, the forwards will backcheck mightily and crash towards the net - but this often leaves a lot of cracks, such as an opposing dman being wide open for a high quality scoring chance.\\- Breakouts. We have a lot of trouble getting clean breakouts against teams that play a tight neutral zone / back checking game. Canucks are most deadly on the transition but a lot of teams are finding that out (even SJS) and are closing up those gaps, not allowing any speed through the neutral zone and making cross-ice passes unavailable. Find that even if we have possession and can successfully break out, the only option is to do a simple dump and chase. This works well for our third line, but for the Petey line it simply is not their forte so it ultimately becomes a change of possession.   \\- Shifts are too long. Especially in the 2nd period, players are forechecking hard but as soon as there is a turnover in the offensive zone, expect a long shift in our defensive zone with overexerted players. Even the best teams with the best systems WILL break down if their players are tired.\\- Special teams. PK has not been as aggressive compared to earlier. Rather than have a 2 and 2 square formation, they have more of a diamond formation where one of the defenders will sometimes go up to one of the wings. It's a bit awkward and has been broken down. The problem with this is it can leave gaps down low, almost creating a 2-on-1 opportunity, allowing for cross-seam passes closer to the net. Good teams are noticing this and adjusting their PP accordingly, getting high quality chances.  \\- The powerplay currently has two big issues. Faceoffs and zone entries. I like Hronek but don't think the powerplay is as dynamic with him instead of Kuzmenko, though I recognize he may still be adjusting. They face problems with aggressive penalty killing which IMO is a result of limited passing options being available on the initial \"set-up\". Very dynamic powerplays work it down and then work it back up to create space, and when the PP is at its best, that's exactly what the Canucks do. Haven't seen as much of that recently.\\- Goaltending. This isn't to say Demko / DeSmith have been bad by any means, in fact they are often the better goalie even in games we even lose. With that said, they have slightly regressed also, and Canucks on some nights, unfortunately, are only as successful as their goaltending is. Last night, Demko's rebound control wasn't the best. It's not to say that it directly lead to a goal, but it makes it so much easier for the team when he is able to stop play.\\- Load management. It's funny cause this is always a big part in other sports but it seems like in hockey you always expect the players to play at 120% and a full 60 minutes. The reality is, we have to learn how to play successfully at 80%. To me, this is what made the Sedins extremely successful - but also consistently sustainable - compared to other players that simply burnout. This may be a maturity thing, but the Canucks need to learn how to slow the game down when they aren't playing at 120%. To me, every game looks like a sprint, and it's no wonder they are feeling the effects of this only a quarter way into the season. If they want to be successful, they have to slow the game down in sync.",

I know they call him factor for a reason. He is not going to kill you stats wise but he has some intangibles that make him relevant. St. Louis had a passing of the guard to a younger team and Nashville being a younger team I thought his better days were behind him.He has a great start better than any of his previous seasons. The leadership and mentorship is bleeding through my TV. Seems like he wanted to be here and he has something to prove. The right mix in my book just thought he was going to do what other old timers do and come out here and go to pasture.",
