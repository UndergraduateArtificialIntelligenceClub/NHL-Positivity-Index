I am clearly not looking for the same kind of thing you are in a play-by-play guy. I want a good voice and a talent for exciting calls. Perhaps you want a homer who cheers when his team scores and is unhappy when the other team scores. Perhaps you want someone like Jack Edwards who will defend the dirty plays of your team and rant about the dirty plays of the opposition. I cannot stand those guys.Maybe I am in the minority on a Leafs subreddit, but fortunately, in the real world, the Leafs have such a huge fan base and practically every game is a national broadcast, so they will probably never get a homer calling the games. Being such a huge market, they tend to get the most skilled and sought after guys.",
    "FUCK YEAH JOEY",
    "Wait. What happened to Woll?",
    "We look like we don't belong here",
    "Hahah I should follow in your footsteps. It definitely is maddening. üòµ‚Äçüí´",
    "Are you FUCKING JOKING",
    "Some losses you can walk away from feeling good about yourself. Not these losses. These are painful.",
    "PROPHET",
    "Good kill.  Time to counter.",
    "Do we think Otter has been playing hurt lately and it became more serious?",
    "There is no universe where we should have Juulsen in over Friedman. We have enough size on the back end with Myers and Myers lite. Let's put in a dman who can actually handle the puck",
    "Just don't even know what to say man. Sharks won 6-3 on 18 SOG, Devils only get 3 on 48. Someone's gotta get fired. Golden opportunity to get into a WC spot and we blow it. Absolutely fucking unacceptable.",
    "WHO ELSE BUT HUGHES",
    "Shorty time",
    "Miller is a truck üõª",
    "Maybe we need our teeth kicked in for a month straight to wake up",
    "Don't understand fake going to his glove then go back the other way. Easy from my couch to say that though",
    "Submit, you moron",
    "He's a beast on the PK is the only reason he stays in I think. Everyone else on the right side is a tire fire and Soucy is injured. Need Bear and another depth body there.",
    "I think they'd focus on a defenseman if a move were to happen",
    "Did you watch the playoffs in 2003?",
    "I know we're all frustrated with recent happenings, but can we take a second to appreciate Thomas? Guy has won nearly 60 percent of FO this year and has had an inconsistent line all year. Averaging a ppg. Loving his play!!",
    "\"The Bruins have been gifted the puck at times ...\"   - you ain't kiddin', Dan",
    "Too many turnovers in our own zone",
    "Good win boys. That's all, that's it. String together a few and we'll talk more.",
    "Get fuuuuucked ungulates.P.S. YOLOnen is one beautiful kid. Such cold-blooded shootout specialist.",
    "Wrong side Grundy-not the glove man. Should have taken to the net.",
    "We Coyotes fans can have a little winning, as a treat",
    "A good omen! When the sub is doom and gloom we play well.",
    "If anyone is snakebitten on this team it's been Slafkovsky. He's been creating some amazing chances for his linemates, and opens up *SO MUCH* room for them. Almost a guarantee to come out of the boards with the puck. Shockingly, Caufield and Suzuki look a step behind Slaf, lol.",
    "Gotta keep taking it to them guys. Don't let off the gas.",
    "Petition the league to make games only 2 periods.",
    "This team doesn't deserve playoffs",
    "This season the habs basically lose one /win one /repeat. No upswings, just plain boring average. I just can't convince myself to bother watching the games. I guess this type of consistency is somewhat promising for building something long term, though the habs fan in me needs a 4 games winning streak or something with an insane Caufield Suzuki display of dominance, even if it means losing the 4 following games lmao.",
    "Green onion crepes with a lettuce wrap type filling.",
    "Yup I checked out a few games ago.  Sometimes I come in a catch the last part of a game but we don't have many exciting players.  It's not fun.",
    "What the fuck is going on here?",
    "Why the fuck is Anthony Manthony so productive now",
    "I am going to have this ESPN+ commercial burned into my brain by the time this season is over",
    "Here we go again ü§ûü§û",
    "So much for us shooting the puck on this power play.",
    "How bout a Binner Goal here up by 2!",
    "GRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUU",
    "They've had some serious injury issues. Having both their 1C and 2C out would cripple any team",
    "Good shot Kreids ends up topping the all time PP goal scorer list",
    "#BACKLUUUUUND",
    "If you get absolutely trashed at a game you'll realize how it's actually an elite goal song",
    "He's just so small for a goaltender is the problem",
    "To be honest I get it. Our division is hilariously competitive and a few losses earlier in the season that we could have won definitely an be the difference between making the playoff or not.",
    "Why the fuck did they start OT like they were playing a penalty kill?No offense at all, that was pathetic.",
    "I'm getting PTSD fladshbacks from last game...",
    "I never notice him, which is good with a defenseman.",
    "Zero effort on defense from Ovie there",
    "We'll either win tonight and lose on Wednesday, or lose tonight and win our next two. Gotta keep the .500 pattern going",
    "#FUCK YES",
    "christ almighty just shoot!!! ffs",
    "I have no problem with how the leafs played in this game. Take the point and move on to the next. Happy for JT",
    "Elite poke by Fleury.",

    "My body isn't ready for the amount of dump and chase that is about to come",
    "hockey is fun in vancouver again as lu said!",
    "So do they just not practice shooting? No one can hit the net ever. The Knights could pull the goalie and the Blues still wouldn't score.",
    "Maybe Toews shouldn't put his face there",
    "my football is straight up trash and doomed to fail so seeing these sharks make hockey fun is a godsend. I love the sharks so damn much lol."
