But that sentence basically sums up our goaltending issues.We actually have a quite solid defense. Check out this [heatmap]( of where we allow shots from. This is the Kings [heatmap]( right now they have the best GA/60 in the league. Our shot qualities are within 0.15 of each other in xGA/60 terms though, despite allowing far more goals.EVERY team is going to have 3-5 lapses a game though. It's just not realistic to expect a group of 5 skaters to go all game, never let anyone behind them, leave a guy unmarked, etc. Not that a coach is ever going to let what lapses remain go, it's something you're trying to drive to 0 -- just nobody can actually do it consistently.When you get down to it, almost every goal in hockey comes on the back end of a defensive lapse. Watch some highlights carefully and you'll usually spot something bad. Just straight up beating the goalie is pretty rare comparatively. The converse is not true though, lapses don't almost always end up in a goal, generally speaking. A league average goalie will save your butt some proportion of the time. Our goaltending this season is just about worst in the league this season unfortunately. That doesn't come primarily from missing soft shots, though there's been a couple of those too. It comes from having a 30% save rate on shots other guys are doing 60% of the time. The hard but not impossible stuff where a defender messes up, but not so badly as to be hopeless.It's really easy to spot when the lapses result in goals. There's a huge bias in perception when it comes to outcome. If hypothetical team 1 allows 2 breakaways in a game and both go for goals, and their hypothetical opponent team 2 allows 5 which are all saved, it's pretty likely that most people are going to say that team 1 has the breakaway problem. That leads people to keep saying that we're leaving goalies out to dry or we have a huge number of defensive lapses. That's just not true. Our defensive play is the one thing that's working right now. There are 3 popular public shot quality models, MoneyPuck, NaturalStatTrick, and HockeyViz. They all put us as a top 5 team at limiting shot quality. We aren't giving up much, but every time we give up anything, it goes in the net. We need more saves, there's just no way around that.That's just on the GA side of the fence. Our offense is pretty bad too, there's no way we manage to improve goaltending enough to make up for that. Both gotta move if we want to win. If both could just move back to *average*, we'd be a pretty good team on the back of our defensive strength.", "#\u0f3c \u3064 \u25d5_\u25d5 \u0f3d\u3064 VGK TAKE MY 3RD PERIOD ENERGY \u0f3c \u3064 \u25d5_\u25d5 \u0f3d\u3064", "That was nothing if not entertaining", "\"Are you ready to play the gaaame.\"", "Whelp, I'm not too upset I was overruled on what game to watch.

Then it's on to another 14 passes in the neutral zone and 45 seconds wasted, leading to either a clear or a corner dump then a clear and do it all again. The difference in this game was Boston's power play vs our power play, and Marchand the Rat drawing soft as fuck penalty calls.

People here complain that timo isn't playing well but frankly it's a repeating pattern that has continued. They tried Lazar, Haula, McLeod and now Meier. And damn if the stat line from the Vancouver game isn't devastating. Y'all can see it here , it's the worst performance for a NJ line I've seen this season or last. And that was a bad defensive game for them. Overall, theyre not caving in but dang if every single line he's a part of doesn't die offensively. I was alright to see if they get going because Haula was back to center Hughes and toffoli. But the second a top 6 player is out of the lineup, it's usually a shuffle of depth guys and wherever Mercer lands is bad. We got this salary cap from Hamiltons ltir, so I hope Fitz can acquire someone SOON cause we're so f****** thin. Every injury at this point is cause to lose games we shouldn't. And I don't wanna hear how well we've been doing. I know we had a solid road trip. It's just we haven't seen peak team performance and it absolutely looks like we're playing a man down even with a full roster. Of course we are. Last season we ended schedule with Mercer on the top line with Hischier and Tatar and they were actually playing like a top line.

Lately in particular he & Stone have really clicked well on a line with Barbashev, and if that line continues at their current level of production, especially when you look at Eichel's point totals from the last 5 games alone, not only will the Knights remain dangerous with their top-line, but Eichel will for sure either hit that 90-100pt pace, if not shatter it!", "Not entirely getting all the Akira love, he made a lot of saves tonight but he was caught looking on two that he let in and had no idea where the puck was, which isn't a good thing.", "SANTA", "I'd like to see Greg's with domi and jarn", "The radio feed got broken into a couple of times by what I assume was RDS's feed.

But my observations are:\\- Too many odd-man rushes going the other way. This usually happens because of our forwards forechecking too deep and getting caught out with 3 men deep. With slower/worse teams, we don't get burnt as bad and it can work in our favour as we can capitalize on mistakes. But against good teams an unsuccessful forecheck is extremely noticeable, often leading to 3 on 2's. To compensate, the forwards will backcheck mightily and crash towards the net - but this often leaves a lot of cracks, such as an opposing dman being wide open for a high quality scoring chance.\\- Breakouts. We have a lot of trouble getting clean breakouts against teams that play a tight neutral zone / back checking game. Canucks are most deadly on the transition but a lot of teams are finding that out (even SJS) and are closing up those gaps, not allowing any speed through the neutral zone and making cross-ice passes unavailable. Find that even if we have possession and can successfully break out, the only option is to do a simple dump and chase. This works well for our third line, but for the Petey line it simply is not their forte so it ultimately becomes a change of possession.   \\- Shifts are too long. Especially in the 2nd period, players are forechecking hard but as soon as there is a turnover in the offensive zone, expect a long shift in our defensive zone with overexerted players. Even the best teams with the best systems WILL break down if their players are tired.\\- Special teams. PK has not been as aggressive compared to earlier. Rather than have a 2 and 2 square formation, they have more of a diamond formation where one of the defenders will sometimes go up to one of the wings. It's a bit awkward and has been broken down. The problem with this is it can leave gaps down low, almost creating a 2-on-1 opportunity, allowing for cross-seam passes closer to the net. Good teams are noticing this and adjusting their PP accordingly, getting high quality chances.  \\- The powerplay currently has two big issues. Faceoffs and zone entries. I like Hronek but don't think the powerplay is as dynamic with him instead of Kuzmenko, though I recognize he may still be adjusting. They face problems with aggressive penalty killing which IMO is a result of limited passing options being available on the initial \"set-up\". Very dynamic powerplays work it down and then work it back up to create space, and when the PP is at its best, that's exactly what the Canucks do. Haven't seen as much of that recently.\\- Goaltending. This isn't to say Demko / DeSmith have been bad by any means, in fact they are often the better goalie even in games we even lose. With that said, they have slightly regressed also, and Canucks on some nights, unfortunately, are only as successful as their goaltending is. Last night, Demko's rebound control wasn't the best. It's not to say that it directly lead to a goal, but it makes it so much easier for the team when he is able to stop play.\\- Load management. It's funny cause this is always a big part in other sports but it seems like in hockey you always expect the players to play at 120% and a full 60 minutes. The reality is, we have to learn how to play successfully at 80%. To me, this is what made the Sedins extremely successful - but also consistently sustainable - compared to other players that simply burnout. This may be a maturity thing, but the Canucks need to learn how to slow the game down when they aren't playing at 120%. To me, every game looks like a sprint, and it's no wonder they are feeling the effects of this only a quarter way into the season.

Like u/Paladad I enjoy Bankier bc he's kind of an all-around prospect. He's kind of good at everything without a glaring weakness in his game other than maybe a question of how good his skating is, how much of \"that dawg\" he's got in him and just generally whether he'll be able to play with enough pace to succeed in the AHL and NHL. Kind of a boom/bust prospects in that sense. In some ways similar to Bankier  (and also transitioning to the Iowa WIld from the Kamloops Blazers) but on defense corps is Kyle Masters. My personal view on NHL defensemen right now is that the most important characteristics are intelligence, size, and skating - in that order. I see Masters as pretty good but not necessarily superlative in all three categories. I generally see him making high awareness plays and not making dumb shit plays (always easier to see from our view than ice level granted) so I think of him as relatively smart. As for size, depending on who's counting, he's 6'0\" and about 180-190#'s. That's not huge but its probably around median NHL defenseman size. Skating is probably his best attribute. He might not be \\*super\\* agile and nimble but he gets around pretty good. Its nowhere near Brodin or Faber tier or even Lambos tier but he's a pretty damn good skater. So overall you have a guy that's pretty good at everything but not superlative at anything.. kinda like Bankier. I mean Bankier is not a great skater but that's less important to me in a forward - you just need at least one or two forwards per line who can push the defense back and create space whereas you really want a defenseman to be a good skater on puck retrievals and if you want him to join the offense in a significant way.", "That's it, Evan Rodrigues is a fucking bum.
