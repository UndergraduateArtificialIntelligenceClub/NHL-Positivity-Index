I will put some of the blame on the 5th goal because Schmid swatted at the puck but then yet again, it was a wide open Shark who got the puck and put it in.  Why was he wide open is the real question.  This is and has been all on the 5 man shitty defensive system the Devils are trying to play.

Perhaps you want a homer who cheers when his team scores and is unhappy when the other team scores. Perhaps you want someone like Jack Edwards who will defend the dirty plays of your team and rant about the dirty plays of the opposition. I cannot stand those guys.Maybe I am in the minority on a Leafs subreddit, but fortunately, in the real world, the Leafs have such a huge fan base and practically every game is a national broadcast, so they will probably never get a homer calling the games.
