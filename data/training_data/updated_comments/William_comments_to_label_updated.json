The Blues not being good now doesn't condemn Armstrong, and it's wild to see people complaining about him. The view/expectations need to be geared towards the future. This is absolutely not a win-now team.If people would just come to terms with reality and realize that the team is/should be mid-reset, they'd see that Armstrong has them in a position now to build a contender again within the next ~3 years, which is far better than the alternative of a full tear-down + rebuild that other teams have gone through that can take 7-10 years (or more for some teams).",
