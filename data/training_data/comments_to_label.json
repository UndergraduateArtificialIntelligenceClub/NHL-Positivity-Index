    "I haven't caught this game till the 3rd. But looking over stats it's pretty consistent game after game that Mercer is just a black hole offensively atm. Idk what's with him, he looked like the future of NJ past 2 seasons and even towards the end of last season and during playoffs he was ripping some crazy shots to boot. This season hes just not working out. I'd even send him to ahl if we didn't need the bodies. The thing that makes sense to me is that if he's going to generate no offense and at least hold down the defense, they should staple him to the 4th line with McLeod and Bastian. As the season progresses they tried everyone to get him and holtz going and really only Haula barely managed to get the line going. People here complain that timo isn't playing well but frankly it's a repeating pattern that has continued. They tried Lazar, Haula, McLeod and now Meier. And damn if the stat line from the Vancouver game isn't devastating. Y'all can see it here , it's the worst performance for a NJ line I've seen this season or last. And that was a bad defensive game for them. Overall, theyre not caving in but dang if every single line he's a part of doesn't die offensively. I was alright to see if they get going because Haula was back to center Hughes and toffoli. But the second a top 6 player is out of the lineup, it's usually a shuffle of depth guys and wherever Mercer lands is bad. We got this salary cap from Hamiltons ltir, so I hope Fitz can acquire someone SOON cause we're so f****** thin. Every injury at this point is cause to lose games we shouldn't. And I don't wanna hear how well we've been doing. I know we had a solid road trip. It's just we haven't seen peak team performance and it absolutely looks like we're playing a man down even with a full roster. Of course we are. Last season we ended schedule with Mercer on the top line with Hischier and Tatar and they were actually playing like a top line. We're genuinely down a top 6 player that was a given, coming into this season.",

    "Hmm. Like u/Paladad I enjoy Bankier bc he's kind of an all-around prospect. He's kind of good at everything without a glaring weakness in his game other than maybe a question of how good his skating is, how much of \"that dawg\" he's got in him and just generally whether he'll be able to play with enough pace to succeed in the AHL and NHL. Kind of a boom/bust prospects in that sense. In some ways similar to Bankier  (and also transitioning to the Iowa WIld from the Kamloops Blazers) but on defense corps is Kyle Masters. My personal view on NHL defensemen right now is that the most important characteristics are intelligence, size, and skating - in that order. I see Masters as pretty good but not necessarily superlative in all three categories. I generally see him making high awareness plays and not making dumb shit plays (always easier to see from our view than ice level granted) so I think of him as relatively smart. As for size, depending on who's counting, he's 6'0\" and about 180-190#'s. That's not huge but its probably around median NHL defenseman size. Skating is probably his best attribute. He might not be \\*super\\* agile and nimble but he gets around pretty good. Its nowhere near Brodin or Faber tier or even Lambos tier but he's a pretty damn good skater. So overall you have a guy that's pretty good at everything but not superlative at anything.. kinda like Bankier. I mean Bankier is not a great skater but that's less important to me in a forward - you just need at least one or two forwards per line who can push the defense back and create space whereas you really want a defenseman to be a good skater on puck retrievals and if you want him to join the offense in a significant way.",

Our defense and goaltending isn't supposed to be in charge of stopping everything, the offense needs to outscore our other issues. Kempe was beyond selfish in that OT and it cost us the game. That's very frustrating. You don't play run and gun hockey in 3 on 3. You prioritize possession and set something up.

The Blues not being good now doesn't condemn Armstrong, and it's wild to see people complaining about him. The view/expectations need to be geared towards the future. This is absolutely not a win-now team.If people would just come to terms with reality and realize that the team is/should be mid-reset, they'd see that Armstrong has them in a position now to build a contender again within the next ~3 years, which is far better than the alternative of a full tear-down + rebuild that other teams have gone through that can take 7-10 years (or more for some teams).",

Yea the team has been really bad defensively lately but i just think quick has made those key saves more often this season and he has been peppered as well soo don't act like Igor has been the only victim of bad d or poor puck management. The difference in my opinion from watching Igor since he's been in the league is that he is a head case and gets frazzled too easily. All Carolina had to do that one year was have the crowd chant his name mockingly the whole series and he was done quick is a proven champion and he is playing vezina quality hockey this season. You are adding other factors into this argument that i am not arguing. I'm arguing the quality of the goaltending that i have seen this season and which goalie i think gives this team a better chance.",

He has the finishers on his line, but he isn't making the smart play when he has the puck, isn't using his speed, or his strength, or his stick.Putting Petey with new linemates won't help becuase the problem is with Petey himself. If he was the finisher on his line, like a Matthews or an Ovechkin, then yes, changing things up and putting him with quick, hard-forechecking wingers might help get him the puck in the right areas to start scoring. But that's not the kind of player Petey is, and that's not the issue that needs fixing with him right now.",

I still think Hakstol should be fired, flat out, and that shouldve been after year 1 but I get giving a chance to an expansion team coach. Flaws? We got tons. It sucks going to these games and consistently losing. Tied for most OTL and just overall terrible puck management. Let's begin!1. Why aren't we shooting the puck? 1st and 3rd period we had, what, 10 shots on goal combined? And 15+ in the 2nd? Why do we do so well on shoot once side in the 2nd? We have so many opportunities to shoot and we wait for the perfect shot. But all of our opponents take shots from everywhere (which is why we get outshot almost every game) and those shots cause ricochets or rebounds for their players to score one. If you have ever played hockey, you know that there's something wrong here with us not shooting.2. Our lines still don't make sense, except penalty kill 1st line. We're out there passing back and forth right in front of our own goalie, not knowing where our teammates are, no hustle, blue line offensive push is awful. If we can't have a good mix of players on the ice, how do we expect to make it past the blue line?3. Outside of Will, Yanni and Tye (sometimes Brandon too), none of our players skate to hit. We lean back, we slow down before a wall, we play the post board shot instead of being aggressive and going for the puck through force. It's sad to watch hits happen on us with no repercussions, even Adam has calmed down compared to his hit opportunities. Don't even get me started on Jamie not being an enforcer at his size...4. Skate... it's simple, that's what they get paid for. Yet we don't - most goals are because there's no defense due to either lack of effort on getting back or slow skating on our part. Sure, you can atteibute some goals to rebounds because our opponents understand that shots from far out equal slchances for rebounds. It's clear we don't understand that part of the game.There's a lot more smaller items that I can gripe about, but these are hockey essentials. Players get hurt and we bring up Firebirds players, but some aren't ready. Evans probably got rocked 5+ times like he was a deer in headlights waiting for it. I get it, 2nd game in the big league can be intimidating but we gotta be more conscious of these things.",

    "> I think that we downgraded both offense and defense slightly in offseason.I see this a lot. I'm not buying it.We lost our 4th line. It was a *great* 4th line, but it was still a 4th line. We added some talent in Yamamoto, Shore, and Bellemare that on paper should have easily replaced Geekie, Donato, and Sprong.We lost Soucy, but we signed Dumoulin, who should have been a fine replacement.And looking back at what analysts were writing about the team in September, I can't find *anyone* who was saying that the team looked worse going into this season.I think the narrative that the Kraken downgraded in the offseason and were supposed to regress is a retcon invented by fans who cannot cope with the reality that the team is simply grossly underperforming this year. They find it comforting to imagine that failing was all part of the plan, so we are doing fine.Its an embarrassingly delusional perspective.",

If Ville Husso is healthy, he comes up and likely puts up a season much like his first professional season in '20-'21 - mediocre. DA got his ass saved by an absolute miracle and has been acting like the smartest man in the room ever since.It would be one thing if we over-committed to the core that brought the Cup here and slowly faded away in the years that followed... you know, like every cup winner in the last decade, but nah - DA decided to speedrun that shit.

    "Last season NaturalStatTrick predicted there would be 8266 goals on the season. Add up the xG for every team basically. That comes from analyzing 122k shots taken over the season.Guess how many goals there actually were?....8248. It was off by 16. So sure, you can find the occasional point result out of a statistical model that looks wrong. They're accurate to within 5% almost every year I've bothered to look at though. There are 2 problems with the objection you initially went for.First is how are you eyeballing a probability? Can you look at a shot and then recall every other attempt and accurately asses how many went in? Lesson #1 when you start looking at these numbers is that the probabilities are lower than you think they should be. A 30% shot is like 2nd percentile. Higher than 50% shots are really hard to get.Second is that even if you're right, can you show the errors all accumulate in one direction? Do you go look for overestimates too? The goal totals suggest the model isn't systematically biased overall, so basically you'd have to come up with a reason why it bites us and not everyone else.I'm guessing you kind of came upon both of those yourself based on your response, which I think is awesome. I feel like what we're calling great games by the goalies is also kind of illustrative of the problem. Yes, last night was a good one for Gru. I'm happy to seem him look good.The problem is most of the other teams are getting that on a regular basis. What we've taken to calling great are just quality starts. I wouldn't call our offense fixed if it had one or two good games, either.And you don't have to and shouldn't go after them above all else, we're still like half a goal shy on average scoring too. We aren't winning crap until both of those things move. It's just strange to hammer on the defense every day when it's legitimately the only area we've been good, lol. Or have trade rumors threads about trading for a goalie with 50 surprised Pikachu face comments about how our goaltending has been fine, when it's by the numbers bottom 3 at least. We're just gaslighting ourselves at this point.",

If he doesn't win the faceoff, then he just gets caved in and holds on for dear life. he might win 54%, [but they're not even coming in high leverage]( hell, he won the faceoff tonight on the same shift that NSH scored their PPG. he might have respectable intangibles and all that but he [sinks whatever line he's on]( and NYR can't do anything but remain stuck in their own zone.26/71/22 have shown what a 4th line is actually supposed to do: get the puck from DZ to OZ and keep it there while the top 9 takes a breather",

Once the  skater is in the offensive zone, he can't be over here and say to the  goalie, like, \"I'm gonna get ya! I'm gonna block your view! You better  watch your butt!\" and then just be like he didn't even do that.1c-b(1).  Like, if you're about to make a goal and then don't leave the crease,  you have to still leave the crease. You cannot not avoid the goaltender.  Does that make any sense?1c-b(2). You gotta be, skating motion out of the crease, and then, until you just leave it.1c-b(2)-a.

If firing the coach is some magic potion we should be sitting on cup mountain rn. Honestly this will fix nothing. Granato is A problem, not THE problem. We need a coaching staff that isn't built of people with zero NHL coaching experience. These people have never been successful anywhere. At all. We are a team led by losers, all the way from GMKA down. Hell Adams never even had a 30pt season as a player and was already fired by this org as an asst coach once. My unpopular opinion? The Pegulas might be the problem. At this point they have fostered a culture of \"I know a guy that can do the job for less.\" Damn near everyone here is someone either GMKA or Donny knows personally. Enough of us here are old enough to understand nepotism and why it rarely ends well. Until they (Pegula and Co.) start spending real money on this team in the right place, they're never going anywhere. Terry talked all that shit about writing a blank check to buy a Stanley cup and all of his employees are barely better than office temp workers willing to work for minimum wage and are just happy to be employed. Apparently that blank check said \"not to exceed X amount of dollars.\" Heads gotta roll. Donny getting gone isn't going to fix a single thing long term and might honestly blow up in the team's face if the players take exception to it.Anyway that's just my opinion.

    "So this was posted before the game yesterday but it's relevant:So Moneypuck After approx. 22 games last year:Money Puck this year right nowThey have dropped in the power rankings by 2 spots, and our Power% is 1.762% lower but still over 50%. Our even strength XGF% has dropped by 1.83 but again is still over 50%. In even strength GF% we have gone from 7th to 11th. I would consider all of that fairly marginal.I don't know if you have an athletic subscription but this is today's power rankings.The Leafs are projected to have 101 points and come 3rd in the division, last year they had 111 points and came 2nd, so again moving down a divisional spot but still being in the divisional matchup does not seem like a huge drop.And Corsi % can be found hereThey went from 53.4 (over the whole season last year so it's not a great comparison considering the Leafs played amazing post TD last year with O'Reilly) to 51.14 this season. Again they are over 50% still.So yes, they are playing marginally worse based on a ton of models, but not at risk of missing the playoffs (and look very likely to be in a divisional spot again). Hopefully the roster construction and new guys help the team play better playoff hockey but that obvs can't be judged yet, I am willing to see though.Goalie stats are much worse, but the goalies are the same as last year so that's pretty random and doesn't really have anything to do with the new GM.",

I do feel like we were misled about his defensive abilities and his goal scoring to some extent but he had 31 in 56 games his last season in Arizona. With ample opportunity here to carve out a spot in the top 6 I think it was very reasonable to think he could improve to being a 50 point guy.
