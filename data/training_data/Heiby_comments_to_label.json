This team should be able to protect a two goal lead. Frankly, this team has to score more than two goals against a team like the Islanders. Our defense and goaltending isn't supposed to be in charge of stopping everything, the offense needs to outscore our other issues. Kempe was beyond selfish in that OT and it cost us the game. That's very frustrating. You don't play run and gun hockey in 3 on 3. You prioritize possession and set something up. Kempe was so desperate to be the hero that he cost us the game, that is very hard to swallow. Sucks that the streak ends like that.

Bedard will be good enough for that Stanley cup ring but he needs a team around him. We need chemistry and depth.",
    "Wheres wifi when you need him‚Ä¶. Oh yeah laval?!",
    "5 greasy trips from Vegas in a row, no calls. Talk about game management. Bettman must have personally called the refs in between periods and threatened their salaries Jesus fucking christ",
    "Wasn't much to cheer for. Kadri gliding into Wolf is inexcusable from a player who makes that much money",
    "I really need the Stars to just start flexin on MFers",
    "Are we fuckin hungover?",
    "On pace for 11 shots...",
    "Go watch the Checkers games. Knight has been pretty solid. Checkers defense is atrocious. Lundell had a rough game vs the Canadiens, but the kid wins a shit ton of faceoffs and plays an aggressive two way game that saved at least one breakaway last night. He's getting sog and just not connecting.The dooming on Lundell is crazy.Edit: I just saw you're rocking Chairot flair. OH BOY",
    "Uh that is textbook interference.",
    "That's game. Shit 5v3.",
    "Upside to a pospisil scratch is he has terrible injury history so no harm in a bit of load management with him, especially with Duehr waiting in the wings",
    "Honestly I felt we played really well. It was fair to criticize the D and goaltending in some of our last few games. This game however, we seemed to actively address our defense, zone exits, etc.",
    "This first line looks absolutely fucking lost. Two panthers by the crease and both D men are looking at the point",
    "If y'all want a nice distraction,  turn on the Yotes game. It's fucking awesome so far as long as you don't like the Caps.",
    "Experience flames hockey",
    "2 minutes for being bigger than the other guy?",
    "He's making the transition as a winger.  Bordeleau looked incomplete as a center in the NHL.",
    "It's not just about low percentage areas, it's about how it's predictable. Goalies and dmen know how to read Ottawa's offense really easily because it's the same every time they have the puck. They know what's coming.",
    "Yak attack!",
    "The good news, Hubey has been the best Flame tonight.The bad news, that's not a hard task.",
    "I am now obsessed with QB getting a hat trick. Please hockey gods",
    "Allllllright that's enough for me tonight",
    "Im done with Pete for a while. Get your fucking shit together. You hold out in contract talks because you want to ‚Äúfocus on the season‚Äù and fucking disappear for 12 fuckin games straight, Well. Not even disappear, be visible in the worst fucking way you can as an ‚Äúall star‚Äù player. Man's asking for Matthews money while putting up 5 points in 12 games. Please.",
    "Zadorov opinions? I missed the game tonight.",
    "Fuck you NHL Network.",
    "Are they running without puck netting above the glass?",
    "zuuuuuuuuuucccccc",
    "Those stairs behind Sal don't go anywhere. What a sham.",
    "How do we trick Zibanejad into thinking they're always on the powerplay Alternatively, is there a way we can always be on the powerplay?",
    "Probably. They generate income.",
    "##WHO FUCKING THOUGHT IT##",
    "Task failed successfully.",
    "Nah, wasn't a high stick. He caught him on the follow-through shooting the puck into the zone.",
    "This is the team I've been waiting to watch all season",
    "Imagine using one period as a representative save percentage",
    "Tro got the 3rd",
    "AW DeSmith looks so happy too!!!!",
    "Panarin vs ex Rangers night",
    "FUCCCCCK THE NHL FUCK THE NHLFUCKTHE NHL",
    "thats a vintage sam excuse me right there",
    "Fuck that would have been a beautiful pass and finish between Garland/Joshua",
    "This has been Wolf's best period in the nhl",
    "He didn't even try and he's still out there.",
    "way better player than connor \"rossi's biatch\" Bedard for sure",
    "Fantastic start",
    "Leah Hextall fucking sucks",
    "Nemec is going to fit right in. LFG",
    "Man I could do with a 649 win. Don't even want that much. Enough to pay off the mortgage would be perfect.",
    "Its time to start worry about Cozens, he\\`s been attrocious",
    "bro this is my first time seeing that video thank you",
    "Dang that was a great set up",
    "Okay VERY rough start, but hey we brought it back to even so all in all okay.",
    "HAHA BYE BRUINS",
    "Papi!",
    "Let's draft some more defensemen!",
    "Consistency? Never heard of her üò≠",
    "He's looking pretty good once again. I wasn't sure if he was gonna be dependable enough but he can make some really athletic saves",
    "This Vasilevskiy bloke is pretty good, huh",
    "He wasn't telling the ref, he was stalling for time so his slow replay team could make the call.",
    "TIL I dont actually know what hooking is",
    "I didn't realize I was watching the Flames own team feed.",
    "Feel sorry for all the fans who paid with their hard earned money.   Samsonov should give the fans a refund",
    "Monty and Slaf looked great",
    "Johnson Fantilli and Bemstrom are too creative. Bench em",
    "It is definitely hurting the marketability of the league. There are people who only watch hockey on the weekends just to listen to THIS",
    "I put that on Eberle. Why the hell would you drop it off to Oleksiak right there",
    "Why was that not icing?",
    "The refs are taking a physical beating today. Such a shame...",
    "I just looked up his speed stats you right, I dum",
    "#HOLY FUCK HAYS",
    "Edmonton hoped he'd turn into a top 6 scorer, but he hasn't developed that way. At this point I think we know he's a bottom 6 guy.",
    "EVERYBODY HIT EVERYBODY!",
    "1-8-0 when Trailing after 2 periods. Now that, is a DJ Smith stat.",
    "I'm on AISH so that's over 70% of my monthly income üòÇ",
    "I'm gunna be honest, I would have gotten the same amount of entertainment if they would have lost that OT with the way this season is going. What an awkward locker room that's gotta be rn.",
    "Huberdeau actually infuriates me, I have never disliked one of our own players so much. What the hell happened. This is gonna go down as one of the worst NHL contracts in history",
    "refs with their worst week in a long time",
    "Like, 1st pass I'm pissed he didn't just shoot across the grain. But it was a sick pass and Barbie should have driven far side. Ugh",
    "Battle of the Lindgrens > Battle of the Hughes",
    "Why no sharo but lindholm",
    "Awful game to be at. I was also at the Panthers blow out a couple weeks ago.Safe to say I aint coming back for a while. Fucking pathetic",
    "#ME IS BIG SAD",
    "what's your poison? Islay, Highland, Speyside ..?",
    "Kraken 5Blackhawks 2",
    "Nylander coasting but he was out of gas. Should have put a fresh player on.",
    "I get these highlights are a small snapshot but kane looks nice",
    "Known dirty dangler Drew Doughty",
    "Zaitsev, reichel, soderblom, raddysh, and TJ off the top of my head.",
    "She loses energy at the end of phrases. She just sounds like she is falling g aslep",
    "Yep, which is nice to see finally. I hope Kuzy also gets his confidence back soon",
    "Tripped over the blue line.",
    "he's got that youthful energy, only 18 years old. understandable that the 23 year olds would have to coast a bit, practically geriatric.",
    "Myers fuck",
    "I missed that. I thought for sure I'd heard on a broadcast a few years back they don't condone it anymore.",
    "This is needless Vitek besmirchment",
    "Jedi master Levi!",
    "A little extreme bro",
    "Big Gordie Howe energy from Cozens there",
    "I mean, he looked good in preseason I guess. I am not hating on the kid. All I am saying is that we drafted a dman with limited offensive upside (forget about the points, this has been a concern since before the draft) while we have no offensive talent.",
    "Someone knock Tom Wilson down please!",
    "Ughh"
