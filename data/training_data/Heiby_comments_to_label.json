Yeah, we got fucked by the refs, but come on. This team should be able to protect a two goal lead. Frankly, this team has to score more than two goals against a team like the Islanders. Our defense and goaltending isn't supposed to be in charge of stopping everything, the offense needs to outscore our other issues. Kempe was beyond selfish in that OT and it cost us the game. That's very frustrating. You don't play run and gun hockey in 3 on 3. You prioritize possession and set something up. Kempe was so desperate to be the hero that he cost us the game, that is very hard to swallow. Sucks that the streak ends like that. Now we have to play the best team in hockey on a back to back with Copley in net. Really needed two points tonight. Good luck tomorrow, because on paper it looks real bad for us.",
