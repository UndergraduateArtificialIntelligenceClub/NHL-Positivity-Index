The difference in my opinion from watching Igor since he's been in the league is that he is a head case and gets frazzled too easily. All Carolina had to do that one year was have the crowd chant his name mockingly the whole series and he was done quick is a proven champion and he is playing vezina quality hockey this season.

He has the finishers on his line, but he isn't making the smart play when he has the puck, isn't using his speed, or his strength, or his stick.Putting Petey with new linemates won't help becuase the problem is with Petey himself. If he was the finisher on his line, like a Matthews or an Ovechkin, then yes, changing things up and putting him with quick, hard-forechecking wingers might help get him the puck in the right areas to start scoring.

I still think Hakstol should be fired, flat out, and that shouldve been after year 1 but I get giving a chance to an expansion team coach. Flaws? We got tons. It sucks going to these games and consistently losing. Tied for most OTL and just overall terrible puck management. Let's begin!1. Why aren't we shooting the puck? 1st and 3rd period we had, what, 10 shots on goal combined? And 15+ in the 2nd? Why do we do so well on shoot once side in the 2nd? We have so many opportunities to shoot and we wait for the perfect shot. But all of our opponents take shots from everywhere (which is why we get outshot almost every game) and those shots cause ricochets or rebounds for their players to score one. If you have ever played hockey, you know that there's something wrong here with us not shooting.2. Our lines still don't make sense, except penalty kill 1st line. We're out there passing back and forth right in front of our own goalie, not knowing where our teammates are, no hustle, blue line offensive push is awful. If we can't have a good mix of players on the ice, how do we expect to make it past the blue line?3. Outside of Will, Yanni and Tye (sometimes Brandon too), none of our players skate to hit. We lean back, we slow down before a wall, we play the post board shot instead of being aggressive and going for the puck through force. It's sad to watch hits happen on us with no repercussions, even Adam has calmed down compared to his hit opportunities. Don't even get me started on Jamie not being an enforcer at his size...4. Skate... it's simple, that's what they get paid for. Yet we don't - most goals are because there's no defense due to either lack of effort on getting back or slow skating on our part. Sure, you can atteibute some goals to rebounds because our opponents understand that shots from far out equal slchances for rebounds. It's clear we don't understand that part of the game.There's a lot more smaller items that I can gripe about, but these are hockey essentials. Players get hurt and we bring up Firebirds players, but some aren't ready. Evans probably got rocked 5+ times like he was a deer in headlights waiting for it. I get it, 2nd game in the big league can be intimidating but we gotta be more conscious of these things.",

Not a masterclass tonight, but some real in-game adjustments helped bring the team back in it. The compete including Shesty did the rest. Love this team. Also thrilled for Brodzinski. Talk about a guy who's played well enough to earn an NHL spot the past few seasons only to be pushed out. Instead of sulking he's gone down, captained the pack, helping young kids like cuylle and Othmann develop, and lit up the AHL. Loved seeing him finally put some points up in the NHL as a reward. Really hope he sticks this time. His track record doesn't suggest it, but I think his speed, hustle, and shot are an asset.",
