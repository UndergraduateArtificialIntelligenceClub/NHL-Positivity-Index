Yea the team has been really bad defensively lately but i just think quick has made those key saves more often this season and he has been peppered as well soo don't act like Igor has been the only victim of bad d or poor puck management. The difference in my opinion from watching Igor since he's been in the league is that he is a head case and gets frazzled too easily. All Carolina had to do that one year was have the crowd chant his name mockingly the whole series and he was done quick is a proven champion and he is playing vezina quality hockey this season. You are adding other factors into this argument that i am not arguing. I'm arguing the quality of the goaltending that i have seen this season and which goalie i think gives this team a better chance.",

He gets into a bit of a rut, and then he gets frustrated, starts overthinking the play, trying to force things to happen instead of reading and reacting.Petey's linemates will always live and die by his ability to drive the play, draw defenders to him and then dish to competent finishers. He has the finishers on his line, but he isn't making the smart play when he has the puck, isn't using his speed, or his strength, or his stick.Putting Petey with new linemates won't help becuase the problem is with Petey himself. If he was the finisher on his line, like a Matthews or an Ovechkin, then yes, changing things up and putting him with quick, hard-forechecking wingers might help get him the puck in the right areas to start scoring. But that's not the kind of player Petey is, and that's not the issue that needs fixing with him right now.",

    "Not even knowing where to start, because last year it was the curse of the blue line but this year its all games right now. I still think Hakstol should be fired, flat out, and that shouldve been after year 1 but I get giving a chance to an expansion team coach. Flaws? We got tons. It sucks going to these games and consistently losing. Tied for most OTL and just overall terrible puck management. Let's begin!1. Why aren't we shooting the puck? 1st and 3rd period we had, what, 10 shots on goal combined? And 15+ in the 2nd? Why do we do so well on shoot once side in the 2nd? We have so many opportunities to shoot and we wait for the perfect shot. But all of our opponents take shots from everywhere (which is why we get outshot almost every game) and those shots cause ricochets or rebounds for their players to score one. If you have ever played hockey, you know that there's something wrong here with us not shooting.2. Our lines still don't make sense, except penalty kill 1st line. We're out there passing back and forth right in front of our own goalie, not knowing where our teammates are, no hustle, blue line offensive push is awful. If we can't have a good mix of players on the ice, how do we expect to make it past the blue line?3. Outside of Will, Yanni and Tye (sometimes Brandon too), none of our players skate to hit. We lean back, we slow down before a wall, we play the post board shot instead of being aggressive and going for the puck through force. It's sad to watch hits happen on us with no repercussions, even Adam has calmed down compared to his hit opportunities. Don't even get me started on Jamie not being an enforcer at his size...4. Skate... it's simple, that's what they get paid for. Yet we don't - most goals are because there's no defense due to either lack of effort on getting back or slow skating on our part. Sure, you can atteibute some goals to rebounds because our opponents understand that shots from far out equal slchances for rebounds. It's clear we don't understand that part of the game.There's a lot more smaller items that I can gripe about, but these are hockey essentials. Players get hurt and we bring up Firebirds players, but some aren't ready. Evans probably got rocked 5+ times like he was a deer in headlights waiting for it. I get it, 2nd game in the big league can be intimidating but we gotta be more conscious of these things.",

    "> I think that we downgraded both offense and defense slightly in offseason.I see this a lot. I'm not buying it.We lost our 4th line. It was a *great* 4th line, but it was still a 4th line. We added some talent in Yamamoto, Shore, and Bellemare that on paper should have easily replaced Geekie, Donato, and Sprong.We lost Soucy, but we signed Dumoulin, who should have been a fine replacement.And looking back at what analysts were writing about the team in September, I can't find *anyone* who was saying that the team looked worse going into this season.I think the narrative that the Kraken downgraded in the offseason and were supposed to regress is a retcon invented by fans who cannot cope with the reality that the team is simply grossly underperforming this year. They find it comforting to imagine that failing was all part of the plan, so we are doing fine.Its an embarrassingly delusional perspective.",

If Ville Husso is healthy, he comes up and likely puts up a season much like his first professional season in '20-'21 - mediocre. DA got his ass saved by an absolute miracle and has been acting like the smartest man in the room ever since.It would be one thing if we over-committed to the core that brought the Cup here and slowly faded away in the years that followed... you know, like every cup winner in the last decade, but nah - DA decided to speedrun that shit.

His lack of back check gives up a good chance, but he stayed out of position long enough to be back into position. Scores a critical goal late in the second.

When is this rebuild going to be considered a failure?Our owner needs to make changes. We can't afford another \"experiment\" to start next season. Put an intern coach behind the bench and see what you have with this roster. Make a permanent change this off season. Sens played well last night but it's the same story over and over.

Prior to Kane and toews the hawks were far worse than what you see here today as there was no hope to be seen. Prospect pool is deep and there's a lot of cap space to go around. Future is bright",

    "An in-game adjustment that doesn't involve promoting offensive juggernaut Barclay Goodrow. What is this sorcery? Not a masterclass tonight, but some real in-game adjustments helped bring the team back in it. The compete including Shesty did the rest. Love this team. Also thrilled for Brodzinski. Talk about a guy who's played well enough to earn an NHL spot the past few seasons only to be pushed out. Instead of sulking he's gone down, captained the pack, helping young kids like cuylle and Othmann develop, and lit up the AHL. Loved seeing him finally put some points up in the NHL as a reward. Really hope he sticks this time. His track record doesn't suggest it, but I think his speed, hustle, and shot are an asset.",

    "Hughes and Hronek looking kinda iffy lately.  Petey with a fantastic game. When that guy plays with heart there's not a lot of players in this league at his level.Lafferty has been a steal. Guy has been sensational all year. Stealth MVP candidate imoBoeser is almost like a power forward now with how dominant he is on the outside. Watching him transform into an outside force has been a treat. Miller being the superhero he normally is.Hog has been feisty lately. Fighting out there.Joshua I thought had a really strong gameHonestly, kinda liked Myers tonight. And Big Zaddy has really impressed me with his mobility. I liked their pairing a lot.Score doesn't reflect how well we played imo. Great game by the team.",
