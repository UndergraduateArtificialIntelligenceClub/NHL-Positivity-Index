The Blues not being good now doesn't condemn Armstrong, and it's wild to see people complaining about him. The view/expectations need to be geared towards the future. This is absolutely not a win-now team.If people would just come to terms with reality and realize that the team is/should be mid-reset, they'd see that Armstrong has them in a position now to build a contender again within the next ~3 years, which is far better than the alternative of a full tear-down + rebuild that other teams have gone through that can take 7-10 years (or more for some teams).",

I get him and Zuccy want to pass it and play pretty, but sometimes, you've just got to chuck it behind teams for a period or two and trust the other lines to get you the lead. It's been two months of this now, and it's pretty obvious it's no longer a coaching issue. Those two need to get over themselves.",
