The Blues not being good now doesn't condemn Armstrong, and it's wild to see people complaining about him. The view/expectations need to be geared towards the future. This is absolutely not a win-now team.If people would just come to terms with reality and realize that the team is/should be mid-reset, they'd see that Armstrong has them in a position now to build a contender again within the next ~3 years, which is far better than the alternative of a full tear-down + rebuild that other teams have gone through that can take 7-10 years (or more for some teams).",

    "I feel like with the Kap line, they are so dedicated to carrying the puck in and playing pretty that they kill the team's rhythm at times in tight games. I get him and Zuccy want to pass it and play pretty, but sometimes, you've just got to chuck it behind teams for a period or two and trust the other lines to get you the lead. It's been two months of this now, and it's pretty obvious it's no longer a coaching issue. Those two need to get over themselves.",
    "Cole threw a bunch of pucks blindly up the boards at the end there. We had like 8 breakout attempts stopped I feel like and a bunch were just pucks thrown up the boards and lost",
    "It's a 6 step program.",
    "I threw some pocket change on SJ & Buffalo to both come back when they were both down 4-1 to win like a grand. So I had it even worse than everybody else! Fucking WNY sports",
    "What a fucking joke league, what determines an instigator penalty ? Clearly he stood up for his teammate and started the fight knowing knowingly, unreal",
    "CASEY I LOVE YOU",
    "How do I upvote something twice?",
    "more hogs and petey!",
    "Sotd? Nice",
    "Lets gooooooo fucking Domi!",
    "I MISSED YOU, OLD FRIEND",
    "Can we get a Foligno assist on a Boldy goal to top off the night?",
    "Fischer couldn't even take him down",
    "And Hrudey just explained why Wolf needs to stay up and play as much as possible. Better to have these kid of growing pains in a lost season then down the road where they're actually competing",

    "CONGRATS COACH",
    "Fil being honest. Love Fil",
    "Shouldn't have lost to Columbus but I'll take this over it being anything in regulation.",
    "wtf is this crap",
    "He's also content to just keep bombing away slapshots (which clearly isn't working) instead of trying anything else",
    "Miro's pissed",
    "Wow, is that the first time they've pulled him?  Might as well hang hang him out to dry at this point.",
    "Intermission iguana:",
    "Surprised they didn't find a way to take that goal away from Calgary.",
    "Boys. What can we do to help Boldy to stop snorting when he's interviewed?",
    "who?",
    "props for Tkachuk with that battle on the board",
    "He's just not that good yet.",
    "The who? Oh, right I forgot the Sens were an NHL team for a minute there…",
    "Rossi has looked like he can legit be our 1C of the future. I could cry",
    "A SINGLE BOUNCE WOULD BE NICE",
    "Poke check!",
    "The regression from Siegs and Marino has not been fun this year",
    "Embarrassing",
    "Wow. That right there is about as random as it gets.",
    "BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO",
    "There was another for canucks score a goal in every period at around 3.5 which I put a bit down on too. Nice night. Except for the over…",
    "League leading 172 games without being shutout",
    "Couldn't watch tonight but popping in to say go sword boys.",
    "stick tapped against his visor and he pulled the best tom and jerry face i've seen in a while",
    "Even 2 games ago.",
    "Wild stat I stumbled across: Fredérick Gaudreau became the first player since Johnny Harms of the 1943–44 Chicago Black Hawks to score his first three career NHL goals in the Stanley Cup Finals",
    "Thanks hofer! Think he'll be here next year?Edit grammar",
    "Bob said to OEL now it's my turn to help the Canucks.",
    "Watching a real goalie not give up a juicy rebound on a shot straight at em is neat hope we can get one",
    "Is zero shots on goal good?",
    "NYCE ONE from gus",
    "Oh yay SHORE well done!",
    "If eating crow was a game",
    "Damn fuck the post but that was a crisp ping",
    "Omg that replay though. Holy fuck that is so beautiful",
    "Except for hubey.",
    "I don't think Hughes and Hronek have spent a single shift in the offensive zone. They're just being way too casual with the puck when they have it. Also 2-0 so that clear and obvious hooking becomes not so clear and obvious.",
    "That was a tough one lanky.  Let's get it back.  Don't let the ice tilt",
    "Is what it is. Thanks for being a good winner. Rough year  for both teams that are stuck in the mucky middle.",
    "IF YOU'RE A GOALTENDER&nbsp;#TEND THE GOAL",
    "I'm not too stressed. It was a backup goalie game. Guaranteed loss from the start. Not a single player or coach showed up tonight. Embarrassing across the board. Offense looked bad. Coaching looked bad. Defense looked bad. Igor looked bad. Refs looked bad. Gameplan looked bad. Physicality looked bad. Effort looked bad.",
    "Indeed. But it isn't the playoffs right now, the flu is going through the team, half our D is out, we're in seventh place, and it's like we're in the cellar.Playoffs, yeah, we all know. But my brother in Christ, we were loving this team one game ago.",
    "Back to back games, so both are going to get a start. Lindgren got to play his brother by starting tonight",
    "Slaf might be one of the best puck protectors I've ever seen, and he's still 19. It's ridiculous how confident I am in him when he goes to work on retrieving the puck. Add in his soft hands and playmaking vision? The points are gonna come if he can maintain this.",
    "A lot of work with who?  There's a handful of players on this team that are gonna be here when they expect to be competing. Who the most important player of those (and probable future captain of the team) I wouldn't ever worry about him wanting to win. The Sabres are in a complete different situation.",
    "I mean no doubt kakko hasn't been good, but I still think he's got a lot of potential and just has to find his fit",
