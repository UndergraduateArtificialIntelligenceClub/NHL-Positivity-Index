We've already retired two numbers from that era in which we saw our most effective team but ultimately no cup.

I could hear Biron and duffer acting like everything is going just fine and rob saying they've whethered the storm. National media calling you out for coasting and no accountability on the team. I know it's not fully on Granato with what happened or lack of what changed over the offseason but when your team clearly doesn't show up and you refuse to hold players accountable then you are part of the problem too.",

Yes, he's getting shoots goal but they are not quality shots. I hope he gets his shit together and proves me wrong.

    "Can't even be upset over that loss.  Just another example of refs needing to call majors because if not players will do it their own way and the game goes completely off the rails.  Then again we got to witness a murder and it only cost one person $5000 which is the maximum fine under the current CBA",
    "FWIW it's definitely an intentional strategic choice to let the opponents rack up low quality shots from the outside while we turtle and protect the middle to hold a lead. Makes our stats (and PDO) look bad but it's clearly effective all things considered",

    "The only thing that makes sense is that Tocchet is so concerned about his defensive play, he doesn't care if he contributes to offence right now. There's no other reason to put him on the 4th line. I'd even argue that it's better to scratch him than play him on the 4th line.Edit: that said, these line projections are from December 9th.",
