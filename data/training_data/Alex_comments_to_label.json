    "It would be nice to see Garland rewarded with a goal, that pass to Blueger tonight was great though.",
    "This defensive structure is embarrassing. Even if we did make the playoffs we would struggle to win a game",
    "That top line, I like what I'm seeing.",
    "Absolutely. Players can and will peak. Even at 25. I'm not saying I'm ready to get rid of him, I just said he would be my first pick to free up money if he doesn't produce. It won't be Tkachuk getting us to the playoffs this year. Sometimes recovering from a mental injury is harder than a physical one. Dude is totally mentally checked out right now, who knows why. Yes, he's getting shoots goal but they are not quality shots. I hope he gets his shit together and proves me wrong. My guess is you bought a Tkachuk sweater this year and now you feel like you have to defend any criticism of him, even when it's warranted.",
    "and the Holy Spirit.",
    "Demko just out assed Vitek.",
    "These commentators suck bad!",
    "So Richardson in his infinite wisdom starts a shaky goalie, on the road, with half of our top D missing, then has the balls to put a fucking anchor of energy and compete on a line with the one player the Hawks want to see succeed most? I'm starting question some things",

    "Yeah the score is bad but that's my biggest surprise",
    "Way better in action than in the promo shots",
    "Last year when I was doing a practice closing before our actual mock trial, one of the attorneys giving feedback was named Paul and my whole closing argument comparing what happened in our \"case\" to a hockey fight.  When they started giving us feedback, he told me there was one minute left and I said, \"Thanks Paul!\"  Everybody looked at us like we were insane üòÇ",

    "I cannot recall one empty net we've hit this year.",
    "We don't.",
    "Can't even be upset over that loss.  Just another example of refs needing to call majors because if not players will do it their own way and the game goes completely off the rails.  Then again we got to witness a murder and it only cost one person $5000 which is the maximum fine under the current CBA",
    "FWIW it's definitely an intentional strategic choice to let the opponents rack up low quality shots from the outside while we turtle and protect the middle to hold a lead. Makes our stats (and PDO) look bad but it's clearly effective all things considered",

    "The fucking crosschecks are unreal right now",
    "The only thing that makes sense is that Tocchet is so concerned about his defensive play, he doesn't care if he contributes to offence right now. There's no other reason to put him on the 4th line. I'd even argue that it's better to scratch him than play him on the 4th line.Edit: that said, these line projections are from December 9th.",
