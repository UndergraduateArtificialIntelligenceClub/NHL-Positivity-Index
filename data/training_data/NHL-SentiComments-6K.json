What Cassidy is doing with Eichel is perfect for him to reach his 200ft game, while at the same time not hindering Eichel from making elite offensive plays. He's able to make game-breaking plays on both offense & defense under Cassidy's system, and he's not being relied upon to make all the offense happen via being paired with either Marchessault or Stone on his RW. Lately in particular he & Stone have really clicked well on a line with Barbashev, and if that line continues at their current level of production, especially when you look at Eichel's point totals from the last 5 games alone, not only will the Knights remain dangerous with their top-line, but Eichel will for sure either hit that 90-100pt pace, if not shatter it!",

    {
        "comment": "This is a lot if anyone cares to read. But my observations are:\\- Too many odd-man rushes going the other way. This usually happens because of our forwards forechecking too deep and getting caught out with 3 men deep. With slower/worse teams, we don't get burnt as bad and it can work in our favour as we can capitalize on mistakes. But against good teams an unsuccessful forecheck is extremely noticeable, often leading to 3 on 2's. To compensate, the forwards will backcheck mightily and crash towards the net - but this often leaves a lot of cracks, such as an opposing dman being wide open for a high quality scoring chance.\\- Breakouts. We have a lot of trouble getting clean breakouts against teams that play a tight neutral zone / back checking game. Canucks are most deadly on the transition but a lot of teams are finding that out (even SJS) and are closing up those gaps, not allowing any speed through the neutral zone and making cross-ice passes unavailable. Find that even if we have possession and can successfully break out, the only option is to do a simple dump and chase. This works well for our third line, but for the Petey line it simply is not their forte so it ultimately becomes a change of possession.   \\- Shifts are too long. Especially in the 2nd period, players are forechecking hard but as soon as there is a turnover in the offensive zone, expect a long shift in our defensive zone with overexerted players. Even the best teams with the best systems WILL break down if their players are tired.\\- Special teams. PK has not been as aggressive compared to earlier. Rather than have a 2 and 2 square formation, they have more of a diamond formation where one of the defenders will sometimes go up to one of the wings. It's a bit awkward and has been broken down. The problem with this is it can leave gaps down low, almost creating a 2-on-1 opportunity, allowing for cross-seam passes closer to the net. Good teams are noticing this and adjusting their PP accordingly, getting high quality chances.  \\- The powerplay currently has two big issues. Faceoffs and zone entries. I like Hronek but don't think the powerplay is as dynamic with him instead of Kuzmenko, though I recognize he may still be adjusting. They face problems with aggressive penalty killing which IMO is a result of limited passing options being available on the initial \"set-up\". Very dynamic powerplays work it down and then work it back up to create space, and when the PP is at its best, that's exactly what the Canucks do. Haven't seen as much of that recently.\\- Goaltending. This isn't to say Demko / DeSmith have been bad by any means, in fact they are often the better goalie even in games we even lose. With that said, they have slightly regressed also, and Canucks on some nights, unfortunately, are only as successful as their goaltending is. Last night, Demko's rebound control wasn't the best. It's not to say that it directly lead to a goal, but it makes it so much easier for the team when he is able to stop play.\\- Load management. It's funny cause this is always a big part in other sports but it seems like in hockey you always expect the players to play at 120% and a full 60 minutes. The reality is, we have to learn how to play successfully at 80%. To me, this is what made the Sedins extremely successful - but also consistently sustainable - compared to other players that simply burnout. This may be a maturity thing, but the Canucks need to learn how to slow the game down when they aren't playing at 120%. To me, every game looks like a sprint, and it's no wonder they are feeling the effects of this only a quarter way into the season. If they want to be successful, they have to slow the game down in sync.",

But that sentence basically sums up our goaltending issues.We actually have a quite solid defense. Check out this [heatmap]( of where we allow shots from. This is the Kings [heatmap]( right now they have the best GA/60 in the league. Our shot qualities are within 0.15 of each other in xGA/60 terms though, despite allowing far more goals.EVERY team is going to have 3-5 lapses a game though. It's just not realistic to expect a group of 5 skaters to go all game, never let anyone behind them, leave a guy unmarked, etc. Not that a coach is ever going to let what lapses remain go, it's something you're trying to drive to 0 -- just nobody can actually do it consistently.When you get down to it, almost every goal in hockey comes on the back end of a defensive lapse. Watch some highlights carefully and you'll usually spot something bad. Just straight up beating the goalie is pretty rare comparatively. The converse is not true though, lapses don't almost always end up in a goal, generally speaking. A league average goalie will save your butt some proportion of the time. Our goaltending this season is just about worst in the league this season unfortunately. That doesn't come primarily from missing soft shots, though there's been a couple of those too. It comes from having a 30% save rate on shots other guys are doing 60% of the time. The hard but not impossible stuff where a defender messes up, but not so badly as to be hopeless.It's really easy to spot when the lapses result in goals. There's a huge bias in perception when it comes to outcome. If hypothetical team 1 allows 2 breakaways in a game and both go for goals, and their hypothetical opponent team 2 allows 5 which are all saved, it's pretty likely that most people are going to say that team 1 has the breakaway problem. That leads people to keep saying that we're leaving goalies out to dry or we have a huge number of defensive lapses. That's just not true. Our defensive play is the one thing that's working right now. There are 3 popular public shot quality models, MoneyPuck, NaturalStatTrick, and HockeyViz. They all put us as a top 5 team at limiting shot quality. We aren't giving up much, but every time we give up anything, it goes in the net. We need more saves, there's just no way around that.That's just on the GA side of the fence. Our offense is pretty bad too, there's no way we manage to improve goaltending enough to make up for that. Both gotta move if we want to win. If both could just move back to *average*, we'd be a pretty good team on the back of our defensive strength.",

We don't even get take shots most of the time. They're just terrified that two skaters are gonna come out and take the puck away and clear it so that's what always happens. Nobody's ever in position to pass to across the blue line. Then it's on to another 14 passes in the neutral zone and 45 seconds wasted, leading to either a clear or a corner dump then a clear and do it all again. The difference in this game was Boston's power play vs our power play, and Marchand the Rat drawing soft as fuck penalty calls. Their PP got across the blue line in one or two passes, set up the umbrella, and took a high danger shot within 10 seconds both times and it lead to two goals.Try this next time you watch a Jackets power play. Count the passes during the breakout. Then see if we can cross the blue line. Then see if we set up our system. Then see if we take a shot.

On the season Moneypuck had us basically generating equal shot quality to our opponents on average, but goaltending setting us back about half a goal per game. Grubauer fell juuuuuust short of a quality start tonight, was about -0.05, but that's close enough IMO. Out front we just narrowly edged out the shot quality battle, 3.2 to 2.9 or so by the end of regulation. Toronto is almost certainly a playoff team, so that's not bad!I said in a comment prior to the game that if we were going to find success, it would have to look like the goaltending getting back to the 0 saves above expected range, and a minor uptick in production from the skaters.

Idk what's with him, he looked like the future of NJ past 2 seasons and even towards the end of last season and during playoffs he was ripping some crazy shots to boot. This season hes just not working out. I'd even send him to ahl if we didn't need the bodies. The thing that makes sense to me is that if he's going to generate no offense and at least hold down the defense, they should staple him to the 4th line with McLeod and Bastian. As the season progresses they tried everyone to get him and holtz going and really only Haula barely managed to get the line going. People here complain that timo isn't playing well but frankly it's a repeating pattern that has continued. They tried Lazar, Haula, McLeod and now Meier. And damn if the stat line from the Vancouver game isn't devastating. Y'all can see it here , it's the worst performance for a NJ line I've seen this season or last. And that was a bad defensive game for them. Overall, theyre not caving in but dang if every single line he's a part of doesn't die offensively. I was alright to see if they get going because Haula was back to center Hughes and toffoli. But the second a top 6 player is out of the lineup, it's usually a shuffle of depth guys and wherever Mercer lands is bad. We got this salary cap from Hamiltons ltir, so I hope Fitz can acquire someone SOON cause we're so f****** thin. Every injury at this point is cause to lose games we shouldn't. And I don't wanna hear how well we've been doing. I know we had a solid road trip. It's just we haven't seen peak team performance and it absolutely looks like we're playing a man down even with a full roster. Of course we are. Last season we ended schedule with Mercer on the top line with Hischier and Tatar and they were actually playing like a top line.

He's kind of good at everything without a glaring weakness in his game other than maybe a question of how good his skating is, how much of \"that dawg\" he's got in him and just generally whether he'll be able to play with enough pace to succeed in the AHL and NHL. Kind of a boom/bust prospects in that sense. In some ways similar to Bankier  (and also transitioning to the Iowa WIld from the Kamloops Blazers) but on defense corps is Kyle Masters. My personal view on NHL defensemen right now is that the most important characteristics are intelligence, size, and skating - in that order. I see Masters as pretty good but not necessarily superlative in all three categories. I generally see him making high awareness plays and not making dumb shit plays (always easier to see from our view than ice level granted) so I think of him as relatively smart. As for size, depending on who's counting, he's 6'0\" and about 180-190#'s. That's not huge but its probably around median NHL defenseman size. Skating is probably his best attribute. He might not be \\*super\\* agile and nimble but he gets around pretty good. Its nowhere near Brodin or Faber tier or even Lambos tier but he's a pretty damn good skater. So overall you have a guy that's pretty good at everything but not superlative at anything.. kinda like Bankier. I mean Bankier is not a great skater but that's less important to me in a forward - you just need at least one or two forwards per line who can push the defense back and create space whereas you really want a defenseman to be a good skater on puck retrievals and if you want him to join the offense in a significant way.",

That is not to blame Line 4, they are doing what they are supposed to - but they are just not bailing out our expensive underperformers like last year's line did. I am looking forward to some contracts ending and that we hopefully either replenish the team with new Sprongs or invest in top line scorer who still has good goals/$ ratio.",

Could make for 4 rlly dangerous lines. Just a thought.That being said, if kuzy keeps playing like this id guess hes back on the top line for a trial game the next time we lose.

I will put some of the blame on the 5th goal because Schmid swatted at the puck but then yet again, it was a wide open Shark who got the puck and put it in.  Why was he wide open is the real question.  This is and has been all on the 5 man shitty defensive system the Devils are trying to play.  Peewee teams do a better job of picking up open players in the D zone.  Coaches either have to change it or we need new coaching.",

Our defense and goaltending isn't supposed to be in charge of stopping everything, the offense needs to outscore our other issues. Kempe was beyond selfish in that OT and it cost us the game. That's very frustrating. You don't play run and gun hockey in 3 on 3. You prioritize possession and set something up. Kempe was so desperate to be the hero that he cost us the game, that is very hard to swallow. Sucks that the streak ends like that.

The difference in my opinion from watching Igor since he's been in the league is that he is a head case and gets frazzled too easily. All Carolina had to do that one year was have the crowd chant his name mockingly the whole series and he was done quick is a proven champion and he is playing vezina quality hockey this season.

He gets into a bit of a rut, and then he gets frustrated, starts overthinking the play, trying to force things to happen instead of reading and reacting.Petey's linemates will always live and die by his ability to drive the play, draw defenders to him and then dish to competent finishers. He has the finishers on his line, but he isn't making the smart play when he has the puck, isn't using his speed, or his strength, or his stick.Putting Petey with new linemates won't help becuase the problem is with Petey himself. If he was the finisher on his line, like a Matthews or an Ovechkin, then yes, changing things up and putting him with quick, hard-forechecking wingers might help get him the puck in the right areas to start scoring. But that's not the kind of player Petey is, and that's not the issue that needs fixing with him right now.",

I still think Hakstol should be fired, flat out, and that shouldve been after year 1 but I get giving a chance to an expansion team coach. Flaws? We got tons. It sucks going to these games and consistently losing. Tied for most OTL and just overall terrible puck management. Let's begin!1. Why aren't we shooting the puck? 1st and 3rd period we had, what, 10 shots on goal combined? And 15+ in the 2nd? Why do we do so well on shoot once side in the 2nd? We have so many opportunities to shoot and we wait for the perfect shot. But all of our opponents take shots from everywhere (which is why we get outshot almost every game) and those shots cause ricochets or rebounds for their players to score one. If you have ever played hockey, you know that there's something wrong here with us not shooting.2. Our lines still don't make sense, except penalty kill 1st line. We're out there passing back and forth right in front of our own goalie, not knowing where our teammates are, no hustle, blue line offensive push is awful. If we can't have a good mix of players on the ice, how do we expect to make it past the blue line?3. Outside of Will, Yanni and Tye (sometimes Brandon too), none of our players skate to hit. We lean back, we slow down before a wall, we play the post board shot instead of being aggressive and going for the puck through force. It's sad to watch hits happen on us with no repercussions, even Adam has calmed down compared to his hit opportunities. Don't even get me started on Jamie not being an enforcer at his size...4. Skate... it's simple, that's what they get paid for. Yet we don't - most goals are because there's no defense due to either lack of effort on getting back or slow skating on our part. Sure, you can atteibute some goals to rebounds because our opponents understand that shots from far out equal slchances for rebounds. It's clear we don't understand that part of the game.There's a lot more smaller items that I can gripe about, but these are hockey essentials. Players get hurt and we bring up Firebirds players, but some aren't ready. Evans probably got rocked 5+ times like he was a deer in headlights waiting for it. I get it, 2nd game in the big league can be intimidating but we gotta be more conscious of these things.",

We added some talent in Yamamoto, Shore, and Bellemare that on paper should have easily replaced Geekie, Donato, and Sprong.We lost Soucy, but we signed Dumoulin, who should have been a fine replacement.And looking back at what analysts were writing about the team in September, I can't find *anyone* who was saying that the team looked worse going into this season.I think the narrative that the Kraken downgraded in the offseason and were supposed to regress is a retcon invented by fans who cannot cope with the reality that the team is simply grossly underperforming this year. They find it comforting to imagine that failing was all part of the plan, so we are doing fine.Its an embarrassingly delusional perspective.",

Ask Hawks, Kings, or Lightning fans if they're upset about seeing their leaders get overpaid to ride out their careers - shit, I'd take that in a heartbeat over watching the first Blues captain to hoist the cup anchor the blue-line for fucking Las Vegas' cup run while we hang out in the basement with the worst defense I've ever seen.",
