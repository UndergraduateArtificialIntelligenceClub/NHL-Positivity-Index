    "[Recap: MIN @ CGY](",
    "I'm excited to see these line combos in action again.",
    "Seth Jarvis is an interesting looking dude",
    "",
    "I'm happy with this",
    "They should leave it to a vote and then we all vote John Scott",
    "Just as soon as I about give up in the Jackets they go and on a performance like that. The Blackhawks game was the last time. Russian line looked excellent, Fantilli played a 2 way game tonight. Blankenburg needs to stay, I don't care if he can't keep that level up all year, I'd rather have him when available than Boqvist/Peeke",
    "LET'S GET THIS SHIT! LET'S GET THIS SHIT!LETS!!!! GET!!!! THIS!!!! SHIIIIIIIIIIT!!!!",
    "LGB",
    "Donnys about to learn it's easier to fire a coach than it is to change your players",
    "3-0. No shots on goal. My gummy is kicking in. I'm going to find something else to do with my night.",
    "I feel like we're playing the East German Olympic team‚Ä¶.",
    "I hate in game interviews. They are all the same and offer no insight.‚ÄúYea, we're just focused on playing our game‚Äù",
    "Spit I assume ....unless",
    "Oh god it's not SinghIt's a fucking Christmas miracle",
    "Refs lost control. Quick should spear the next pos who comes near him.",
    "Crosby is winless in playoff series against Montreal. üòá",
    "I gotta remind myself that's it's a tough time of year for a lot of people. Easy to overreact about things",
    "I feel like 80 percent of the stars shots get blocked lol",
    "How do we keep the brock months going in January? Brockuary?",
    "Lol the tears fuel me",
    "Tyler fucking Myers",
    "Oh shit, didn't realize it was already baseball season.  5 run deficit to the Dbacks isn't insurmountable for the Nats. Plenty of time to get back in the game. Calling it now, Joey Meneses grand slam!!",
    "Berman! Love that dude!Wonder what brought him here?",
    "How do they figure Dubois should get a penalty there?",
    "Just now finding out the game isn't starting until 8pm and now im sad",
    "What a joke",
    "Lazy, dog shit hockey. Again",
    "Might be Petey.",
    "Strength and Identity are born from adversity. You'd understand that if you had any of the former two or experience with the latter. Thank god you have no agency in any team because it would be an absolute clusterfuck.",
    "Why are the fans so mad? Do they think we're going to score?",
    "Offer declined. Counter offer: 7-0 win and ADB leaves the ice in tears.",
    "Washington sammy is back when woll gets back we need to send him down to the marlies",
    "Alright that was a sick play",
    "Dads getting wild",
    "Canes getting the saves.",
    "We basically had 4 points locked down in these last two games and leaving with 0",
    "I don't care who's making the shots, as long as they make them.",
    "Pretty sure he is under a .910 svp on the year, that's fucking pedestrian",
    "Mika is having a poor game",
    "Atta boy gus",
    "Haha",
    "Do they think they're still on the PK? wtf are you doing",
    "What a fucking joke",
    "At the game.. that was beautiful",
    "Saving them all for the 3rd. Noice. GKG!!!!!",
    "I think I miss Dean. Not necessarily the coaching, though. I miss the TV crew cutting to him glaring angrily at the action.",
    "It's Martin fucking Jones in the opposing net. They can come back if they just put in like any amount of real effort",
    "We want a goal",
    "josh...",
    "Anyone who is upset just know this: I stumbled upon a Jeff Marek podcast today and he had a chat with our beloved Sam. This made me happy. Try it out.",
    "Damn it's intermission already that period flew by",
    "I'm hoping you're right. Last game he got effectively benched in the third in favor of Danforth taking Boone's minutes.",
    "4 T H  L I N E  ü¶ë",
    "me who hasn't owned a pair of skates since i was 12edit: for the record I like Tocchet",
    "not a smart pinch from Nemec and not great giving up a shorty with less then 30 seconds left, but it could honestly be even worse. brutal period. not sure what happened to our speed and offensive acumen but get it together, very winnable game.",
    "I get the frustration and don't get me wrong I love a good chirpy, fired up Brady, but I do wish sometimes (this time included) he had a bit more restraint/control. That situation sucked and definitely felt cheap but what we need from a captain isn't someone who takes a 10 at the end of a rough game just because of frustration",
    "bc josh anderson skates fast and fought a guy like 5 games ago",
    "He articulates the play quite well. I mentioned this during the post-game of the loss to NJ. We're used to hearing cliche non-answers from them so it's refreshing that Miller of all people is able to verbalize what went wrong or what went right and to speak about it in a professional manner instead of his usual grumpy bear responses. It also helps that the media has been good to him this season and hasn't been asked a stupid, drama-seeking question.",
    "Would be cool if they saw Karlsson do the same thing to Trocheck a few seconds later.",
    "Fiala finally passed a puck so hard he broke his stick",
    "Reading your comments is quite possibly one of the best things to happen before I've had my morning coffee. If i had read it during coffee time it might have ended up on my pajamas.",
    "Canucks will get the next power play soon..Edit:  the second I posted it.. game management is the most predictable thing ever",
    "rossi is looking more and more legit with every game. so happy he's been able to find his game in the NHL",
    "It happened again?!",
    "From what I've read it's already statistically pretty friggin bleak, but it's not impossible yet. Moneypuck has us at 15% to get in with a projected 81 points, 6% to make it out of the first round. Not even gonna mention our projected odds at the cup.Hockey reference has us as better than 16%And then the athletic has us at 7% to make the playoffs which was the lowest I saw.On the bright side moneypuck only gives us a 5% chance at getting first pick (which let's be fair San Jose is gonna have to get screwed by the lottery royally to not get 1st pick this year) so heeyyy at least we're not that bad right? üôÑ",
    "Talk about a stolen period",
    "How the fuck did we the penalty there!?",
    "Holy shit this fucker can shoot.",
    "I laugh at every single Lav victory story line because I used to shit on Gallant for so long and people down voted because the team was winning. We were winning in spite of his ineptitude... Now we are winning the games that we would have lost and he would be on the post game talking about how \"we just didn't get the bounces\" or \"the other team played tough tonight\"... Suuuuure....",
    "‚Ä¶ hire quinn?",
    "I'm hoping this is what the 4th line looks like next year with Jost on the other wing.",
    "Come on, I need to hear that horn.At least 7 times.",
    "Wtf sharks you creepy son a guns. Have some couth.",
    "Everything about Vegas infuriates me haha",
    "It's 3-1 right now. See everyone in OT",
    "If we give this game away I'll be so fuckin irate",
    "This year was supposed to end the most embarrassing streak in sports‚Ä¶ I'm just sad",
    "I think that's his point with reference to Mika and Kreids",
    "Wolf is wasting his time rn",
    "Chinny Chinny bang bang!!",
    "Did they draft any good goalies after Brodeur?",
    "Getting the possession back only just to shoot in knowing Vancouver covered that last time we played. We cant play the boards against them. We have to be them up the middle.",
    "Give this man the C",
    "Man we're bad",
    "Thanks Mangiapane you did the same thing twice in 5 minutes, moron",
    "This team is awful at the moment here comes the slump",
    "I wanted Anderson and I got it lol",
    "It's really kind of baffling. We have 4 coaches behind the bench (St. Louis, Burrows, Letowski and Robidas) and not a single one has significant NHL coaching experience. It's odd because we recognized this could be an issue with our front office, hence the hiring of Gorton to oversee the rookies like Hughes and Lecavalier, but behind the bench we seemed to completely ignore the need for any kind of experience at all.",
    "Maybe we should save some of these goals for Monday?  ü§£",
    "St Louis played an awesome road game",
    "Really? You have never heard the word sold in the context of sports? Huby and Colesy threw the game",
    "Long term id rather the rangers lose the points i think.  We should end higher than the capitals",
    "HOW IS THAT ONLY A PENALTY ON KREBSGFDI",
    "#MIKEY DONT TAKE NO SHIT LFG",
    "And that's fine. You can do that and still call a spade a spade.",
    "I'm sorry, but the Kyrou/Binner commercial for the snuggles has me dying",
    "",
    "Honestly can't believe there are teams with a worse powerplay than us.",
    "Jamie Benn never picks up his dog's shit."
