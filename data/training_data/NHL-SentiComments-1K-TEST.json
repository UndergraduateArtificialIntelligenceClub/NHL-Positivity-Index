What Cassidy is doing with Eichel is perfect for him to reach his 200ft game, while at the same time not hindering Eichel from making elite offensive plays. He's able to make game-breaking plays on both offense & defense under Cassidy's system, and he's not being relied upon to make all the offense happen via being paired with either Marchessault or Stone on his RW. Lately in particular he & Stone have really clicked well on a line with Barbashev, and if that line continues at their current level of production, especially when you look at Eichel's point totals from the last 5 games alone, not only will the Knights remain dangerous with their top-line, but Eichel will for sure either hit that 90-100pt pace, if not shatter it!",

    {
        "comment": "This is a lot if anyone cares to read. But my observations are:\\- Too many odd-man rushes going the other way. This usually happens because of our forwards forechecking too deep and getting caught out with 3 men deep. With slower/worse teams, we don't get burnt as bad and it can work in our favour as we can capitalize on mistakes. But against good teams an unsuccessful forecheck is extremely noticeable, often leading to 3 on 2's. To compensate, the forwards will backcheck mightily and crash towards the net - but this often leaves a lot of cracks, such as an opposing dman being wide open for a high quality scoring chance.\\- Breakouts. We have a lot of trouble getting clean breakouts against teams that play a tight neutral zone / back checking game. Canucks are most deadly on the transition but a lot of teams are finding that out (even SJS) and are closing up those gaps, not allowing any speed through the neutral zone and making cross-ice passes unavailable. Find that even if we have possession and can successfully break out, the only option is to do a simple dump and chase. This works well for our third line, but for the Petey line it simply is not their forte so it ultimately becomes a change of possession.   \\- Shifts are too long. Especially in the 2nd period, players are forechecking hard but as soon as there is a turnover in the offensive zone, expect a long shift in our defensive zone with overexerted players. Even the best teams with the best systems WILL break down if their players are tired.\\- Special teams. PK has not been as aggressive compared to earlier. Rather than have a 2 and 2 square formation, they have more of a diamond formation where one of the defenders will sometimes go up to one of the wings. It's a bit awkward and has been broken down. The problem with this is it can leave gaps down low, almost creating a 2-on-1 opportunity, allowing for cross-seam passes closer to the net. Good teams are noticing this and adjusting their PP accordingly, getting high quality chances.  \\- The powerplay currently has two big issues. Faceoffs and zone entries. I like Hronek but don't think the powerplay is as dynamic with him instead of Kuzmenko, though I recognize he may still be adjusting. They face problems with aggressive penalty killing which IMO is a result of limited passing options being available on the initial \"set-up\". Very dynamic powerplays work it down and then work it back up to create space, and when the PP is at its best, that's exactly what the Canucks do. Haven't seen as much of that recently.\\- Goaltending. This isn't to say Demko / DeSmith have been bad by any means, in fact they are often the better goalie even in games we even lose. With that said, they have slightly regressed also, and Canucks on some nights, unfortunately, are only as successful as their goaltending is. Last night, Demko's rebound control wasn't the best. It's not to say that it directly lead to a goal, but it makes it so much easier for the team when he is able to stop play.\\- Load management. It's funny cause this is always a big part in other sports but it seems like in hockey you always expect the players to play at 120% and a full 60 minutes. The reality is, we have to learn how to play successfully at 80%. To me, this is what made the Sedins extremely successful - but also consistently sustainable - compared to other players that simply burnout. This may be a maturity thing, but the Canucks need to learn how to slow the game down when they aren't playing at 120%. To me, every game looks like a sprint, and it's no wonder they are feeling the effects of this only a quarter way into the season. If they want to be successful, they have to slow the game down in sync.",

But that sentence basically sums up our goaltending issues.We actually have a quite solid defense. Check out this [heatmap]( of where we allow shots from. This is the Kings [heatmap]( right now they have the best GA/60 in the league. Our shot qualities are within 0.15 of each other in xGA/60 terms though, despite allowing far more goals.EVERY team is going to have 3-5 lapses a game though. It's just not realistic to expect a group of 5 skaters to go all game, never let anyone behind them, leave a guy unmarked, etc. Not that a coach is ever going to let what lapses remain go, it's something you're trying to drive to 0 -- just nobody can actually do it consistently.When you get down to it, almost every goal in hockey comes on the back end of a defensive lapse. Watch some highlights carefully and you'll usually spot something bad. Just straight up beating the goalie is pretty rare comparatively. The converse is not true though, lapses don't almost always end up in a goal, generally speaking. A league average goalie will save your butt some proportion of the time. Our goaltending this season is just about worst in the league this season unfortunately. That doesn't come primarily from missing soft shots, though there's been a couple of those too. It comes from having a 30% save rate on shots other guys are doing 60% of the time. The hard but not impossible stuff where a defender messes up, but not so badly as to be hopeless.It's really easy to spot when the lapses result in goals. There's a huge bias in perception when it comes to outcome. If hypothetical team 1 allows 2 breakaways in a game and both go for goals, and their hypothetical opponent team 2 allows 5 which are all saved, it's pretty likely that most people are going to say that team 1 has the breakaway problem. That leads people to keep saying that we're leaving goalies out to dry or we have a huge number of defensive lapses. That's just not true. Our defensive play is the one thing that's working right now. There are 3 popular public shot quality models, MoneyPuck, NaturalStatTrick, and HockeyViz. They all put us as a top 5 team at limiting shot quality. We aren't giving up much, but every time we give up anything, it goes in the net. We need more saves, there's just no way around that.That's just on the GA side of the fence. Our offense is pretty bad too, there's no way we manage to improve goaltending enough to make up for that. Both gotta move if we want to win. If both could just move back to *average*, we'd be a pretty good team on the back of our defensive strength.",

We don't even get take shots most of the time. They're just terrified that two skaters are gonna come out and take the puck away and clear it so that's what always happens. Nobody's ever in position to pass to across the blue line. Then it's on to another 14 passes in the neutral zone and 45 seconds wasted, leading to either a clear or a corner dump then a clear and do it all again. The difference in this game was Boston's power play vs our power play, and Marchand the Rat drawing soft as fuck penalty calls. Their PP got across the blue line in one or two passes, set up the umbrella, and took a high danger shot within 10 seconds both times and it lead to two goals.Try this next time you watch a Jackets power play. Count the passes during the breakout. Then see if we can cross the blue line. Then see if we set up our system. Then see if we take a shot. The biggest problem last night was the neutral zone breakout then not setting up the system.",

I just want to watch competitive, entertaining games every night, and this one was a banger.Solid outing for Grubauer! On the season Moneypuck had us basically generating equal shot quality to our opponents on average, but goaltending setting us back about half a goal per game. Grubauer fell juuuuuust short of a quality start tonight, was about -0.05, but that's close enough IMO. Out front we just narrowly edged out the shot quality battle, 3.2 to 2.9 or so by the end of regulation. Toronto is almost certainly a playoff team, so that's not bad!I said in a comment prior to the game that if we were going to find success, it would have to look like the goaltending getting back to the 0 saves above expected range, and a minor uptick in production from the skaters. Tonight we got exactly that, and in theory I think this is at least sustainable.",
