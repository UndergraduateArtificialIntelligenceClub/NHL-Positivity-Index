He's kind of good at everything without a glaring weakness in his game other than maybe a question of how good his skating is, how much of \"that dawg\" he's got in him and just generally whether he'll be able to play with enough pace to succeed in the AHL and NHL. Kind of a boom/bust prospects in that sense. In some ways similar to Bankier  (and also transitioning to the Iowa WIld from the Kamloops Blazers) but on defense corps is Kyle Masters. My personal view on NHL defensemen right now is that the most important characteristics are intelligence, size, and skating - in that order. I see Masters as pretty good but not necessarily superlative in all three categories. I generally see him making high awareness plays and not making dumb shit plays (always easier to see from our view than ice level granted) so I think of him as relatively smart. As for size, depending on who's counting, he's 6'0\" and about 180-190#'s. That's not huge but its probably around median NHL defenseman size. Skating is probably his best attribute. He might not be \\*super\\* agile and nimble but he gets around pretty good. Its nowhere near Brodin or Faber tier or even Lambos tier but he's a pretty damn good skater. So overall you have a guy that's pretty good at everything but not superlative at anything.. kinda like Bankier. I mean Bankier is not a great skater but that's less important to me in a forward - you just need at least one or two forwards per line who can push the defense back and create space whereas you really want a defenseman to be a good skater on puck retrievals and if you want him to join the offense in a significant way.",
