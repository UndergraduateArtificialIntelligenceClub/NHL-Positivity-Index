        "comment": "I haven't caught this game till the 3rd. But looking over stats it's pretty consistent game after game that Mercer is just a black hole offensively atm. Idk what's with him, he looked like the future of NJ past 2 seasons and even towards the end of last season and during playoffs he was ripping some crazy shots to boot. This season hes just not working out. I'd even send him to ahl if we didn't need the bodies. The thing that makes sense to me is that if he's going to generate no offense and at least hold down the defense, they should staple him to the 4th line with McLeod and Bastian. As the season progresses they tried everyone to get him and holtz going and really only Haula barely managed to get the line going. People here complain that timo isn't playing well but frankly it's a repeating pattern that has continued. They tried Lazar, Haula, McLeod and now Meier. And damn if the stat line from the Vancouver game isn't devastating. Y'all can see it here , it's the worst performance for a NJ line I've seen this season or last. And that was a bad defensive game for them. Overall, theyre not caving in but dang if every single line he's a part of doesn't die offensively. I was alright to see if they get going because Haula was back to center Hughes and toffoli. But the second a top 6 player is out of the lineup, it's usually a shuffle of depth guys and wherever Mercer lands is bad. We got this salary cap from Hamiltons ltir, so I hope Fitz can acquire someone SOON cause we're so f****** thin. Every injury at this point is cause to lose games we shouldn't. And I don't wanna hear how well we've been doing. I know we had a solid road trip. It's just we haven't seen peak team performance and it absolutely looks like we're playing a man down even with a full roster. Of course we are. Last season we ended schedule with Mercer on the top line with Hischier and Tatar and they were actually playing like a top line. We're genuinely down a top 6 player that was a given, coming into this season.",

    "Hmm. Like u/Paladad I enjoy Bankier bc he's kind of an all-around prospect. He's kind of good at everything without a glaring weakness in his game other than maybe a question of how good his skating is, how much of \"that dawg\" he's got in him and just generally whether he'll be able to play with enough pace to succeed in the AHL and NHL. Kind of a boom/bust prospects in that sense. In some ways similar to Bankier  (and also transitioning to the Iowa WIld from the Kamloops Blazers) but on defense corps is Kyle Masters. My personal view on NHL defensemen right now is that the most important characteristics are intelligence, size, and skating - in that order. I see Masters as pretty good but not necessarily superlative in all three categories. I generally see him making high awareness plays and not making dumb shit plays (always easier to see from our view than ice level granted) so I think of him as relatively smart. As for size, depending on who's counting, he's 6'0\" and about 180-190#'s. That's not huge but its probably around median NHL defenseman size. Skating is probably his best attribute. He might not be \\*super\\* agile and nimble but he gets around pretty good. Its nowhere near Brodin or Faber tier or even Lambos tier but he's a pretty damn good skater. So overall you have a guy that's pretty good at everything but not superlative at anything.. kinda like Bankier. I mean Bankier is not a great skater but that's less important to me in a forward - you just need at least one or two forwards per line who can push the defense back and create space whereas you really want a defenseman to be a good skater on puck retrievals and if you want him to join the offense in a significant way.",

Could make for 4 rlly dangerous lines. Just a thought.That being said, if kuzy keeps playing like this id guess hes back on the top line for a trial game the next time we lose.
