But that sentence basically sums up our goaltending issues.We actually have a quite solid defense. Check out this [heatmap]( of where we allow shots from. This is the Kings [heatmap]( right now they have the best GA/60 in the league. Our shot qualities are within 0.15 of each other in xGA/60 terms though, despite allowing far more goals.EVERY team is going to have 3-5 lapses a game though. It's just not realistic to expect a group of 5 skaters to go all game, never let anyone behind them, leave a guy unmarked, etc. Not that a coach is ever going to let what lapses remain go, it's something you're trying to drive to 0 -- just nobody can actually do it consistently.When you get down to it, almost every goal in hockey comes on the back end of a defensive lapse. Watch some highlights carefully and you'll usually spot something bad. Just straight up beating the goalie is pretty rare comparatively. The converse is not true though, lapses don't almost always end up in a goal, generally speaking. A league average goalie will save your butt some proportion of the time. Our goaltending this season is just about worst in the league this season unfortunately. That doesn't come primarily from missing soft shots, though there's been a couple of those too. It comes from having a 30% save rate on shots other guys are doing 60% of the time. The hard but not impossible stuff where a defender messes up, but not so badly as to be hopeless.It's really easy to spot when the lapses result in goals. There's a huge bias in perception when it comes to outcome. If hypothetical team 1 allows 2 breakaways in a game and both go for goals, and their hypothetical opponent team 2 allows 5 which are all saved, it's pretty likely that most people are going to say that team 1 has the breakaway problem. That leads people to keep saying that we're leaving goalies out to dry or we have a huge number of defensive lapses. That's just not true. Our defensive play is the one thing that's working right now. There are 3 popular public shot quality models, MoneyPuck, NaturalStatTrick, and HockeyViz. They all put us as a top 5 team at limiting shot quality. We aren't giving up much, but every time we give up anything, it goes in the net. We need more saves, there's just no way around that.That's just on the GA side of the fence. Our offense is pretty bad too, there's no way we manage to improve goaltending enough to make up for that. Both gotta move if we want to win. If both could just move back to *average*, we'd be a pretty good team on the back of our defensive strength.": "NEG"

Idk what's with him, he looked like the future of NJ past 2 seasons and even towards the end of last season and during playoffs he was ripping some crazy shots to boot. This season hes just not working out. I'd even send him to ahl if we didn't need the bodies. The thing that makes sense to me is that if he's going to generate no offense and at least hold down the defense, they should staple him to the 4th line with McLeod and Bastian. As the season progresses they tried everyone to get him and holtz going and really only Haula barely managed to get the line going. People here complain that timo isn't playing well but frankly it's a repeating pattern that has continued. They tried Lazar, Haula, McLeod and now Meier. And damn if the stat line from the Vancouver game isn't devastating. Y'all can see it here , it's the worst performance for a NJ line I've seen this season or last. And that was a bad defensive game for them. Overall, theyre not caving in but dang if every single line he's a part of doesn't die offensively. I was alright to see if they get going because Haula was back to center Hughes and toffoli. But the second a top 6 player is out of the lineup, it's usually a shuffle of depth guys and wherever Mercer lands is bad. We got this salary cap from Hamiltons ltir, so I hope Fitz can acquire someone SOON cause we're so f****** thin. Every injury at this point is cause to lose games we shouldn't. And I don't wanna hear how well we've been doing. I know we had a solid road trip. It's just we haven't seen peak team performance and it absolutely looks like we're playing a man down even with a full roster. Of course we are.

I just want to watch competitive, entertaining games every night, and this one was a banger.Solid outing for Grubauer! On the season Moneypuck had us basically generating equal shot quality to our opponents on average, but goaltending setting us back about half a goal per game. Grubauer fell juuuuuust short of a quality start tonight, was about -0.05, but that's close enough IMO. Out front we just narrowly edged out the shot quality battle, 3.2 to 2.9 or so by the end of regulation. Toronto is almost certainly a playoff team, so that's not bad!I said in a comment prior to the game that if we were going to find success, it would have to look like the goaltending getting back to the 0 saves above expected range, and a minor uptick in production from the skaters. Tonight we got exactly that, and in theory I think this is at least sustainable.": "POS"
